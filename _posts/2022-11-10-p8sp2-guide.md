This is (supposed to be) a short summary of the P8S phase 2 fight, based on the video guide by joonbob. This is meant to be a quick reference after already having watched the guide/seen some of the fight, to get a quick reference during raid night.

## Natural Alignment 1 (NA1)

(Progged, so doing this later.)

### NA1 Fire Ice

(Progged, so doing this later.)

## High Concept (HC1)

### Short Timers

- Go to assigned corners, receive element.
- **First Towers**: Combine in middle, resolve tower.
- **Unused:** Call out your letter.
- Dodge half-room.
- **First Towers**: Chill at NW, avoid combining.
- **Unused**: Either chill at NW, avoid combining, or go to your letter again to reapply ingredients.

### Stacks

- Two-stack goes to 2-marker, three-stack goes to 3-marker.
- Resolve stacks.
- Dodge half-room.
- Go to corner with long timers: 2-stack goes CW, 3-stack goes CCW. Skip corner called by Unused.
- Receive element.

### Long Timers

- **Alpha:** Go to 2-marker.
- **Beta + Gamma:** Go to 3-marker.
- Resolve stacks.
- Dodge half-room.
- Go to assigned corners, receive element.

### All: Final resolve

- Required element gather between the two north and south towers.
- **Unused + Stacks**: Go between north towers.
- **Long Timers**: Go between south towers.
- Combine, resolve tower.
- Dodge half-room.
- Stay spread until boss finishes casting Deconceptualize.

## Limitless Desolation

Line up like in the picture below on your half of the arena (supports west, DPS east). Picture shows supports, DPS mirror on other side:

Get hit by an AOE, take note of where a tower spawns at the same time. If it is not next to where you are standing, move close via the red line. Bait a puddle on an intersection of squares, then move to soak your tower.

Do not move through other players if you are not 100% sure they have already been hit. Do not move from your starting position until you have been hit. (This way, the red line is always safe to move through.)

## Natural Alignment 2 (NA2)

NA pair can have an "Inverse Magicks" debuff. Their action (spread/stack, fire/ice) has to be performed inversely. Inverse players should jump when the cast bars appear over them, to signal the other players.

For stack, gather in the middle of the safe side (no add on the side), for spread, spread like this (OT and H2 are NA):

![NA2 Spreads]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/p8sp2/na2.jpg)

After that, resolve fire ice same as in NA1, while minding the possible inverse.

## High Concept 2 (HC2)

### Short Timers

- Go to assigned corners, receive element.
- Combine in middle, resolve tower, remember which tower (North/South) was taken.
- Dodge half-room.
- **First Towers**
  - Chill at NW, then go to adds at North/South
  - Rotate clock-wise and bait beams outside.
- **Unused**
  - Standby NW
  - Go middle west to combine, resolve towers.

### Nothing

- Go to Short Alpha, receive element.
- Combine in north to create Ifrit, call who takes East/West add.
- Dodge half-room.
- Chill at NW, then go to adds at East/West
- Rotate clock-wise and bait beams outside.

### Solo/2-Stack + Long Timers

- Solo goes to 3, 2-Stack and remaining go to 2.
- Dodge half-room.
- Go to assigned corners, receive element.
- **Gamma**: Go middle west to combine,.
- **Alpha + Beta**: Go middle east to combine.

### All: Phoenix

- Wind + Ifrit x2 combine.
- Heal party to full before final buff.

## Dominion (Enrage Phase)

Spread similar to NA2 part 1:

![Dominion spreads]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/p8sp2/dominion-positions.jpg)

Then chase first towers if hit, wait then chase second towers if not hit. Supports take two left towers, DPS take right. Prio left to right: MT>OT>H1>H2, M1>M2>R1>R2. Tower spawns may be uneven (i.e. three towers go to the left, one to the right, or all four in one direction).

Return center for healing, then repeat one more time.

Aionagonia deals magical damage, Dominion deals physical.
